The following selection summarizes the key points of a chapter from the book {{title}}:

{{block}}

Produce a narrative version in markdown format that ties together in the key points in a succint but approchable way.  

Group items by them into sections, and use bullet points and emphasis tags to create structure for important events.  Your goal is to make the text as READABLE as possible.  

Use markdown formatting, and make sure the piece always starts with a "# [title of the chapter]" as the first line.

Go no deeper than 2 levels, excluding the title.  Always include narrative text right after a new section.
