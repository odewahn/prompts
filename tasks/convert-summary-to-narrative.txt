The following selection summarizes the key points of a chapter from the book {{title}}:

{{content}}

Produce a narrative version in markdown format that ties together the key points in a succint but approchable way.  

Use markdown formatting, and make sure the piece always starts with a "# [title of the chapter]" as the first line.

Group items into sections, and use bullet points and emphasis tags to create structure for important events.  Your goal is to make the text as READABLE as possible.  

Go no deeper than 2 levels, and always include narrative text right after a new section header so that there is an introduction.
